For this assignment, we were supposed to extend the code of the two source files: "robotArm.html" and "robotArm.js". Before my implementation, the starter code could only move the "robot arm" with one degree of freedom for the base, lower arm and upper arm respectively. However, after my implementation now you can have three degrees of freedom (x, y and z axis) for the base, lower arm and upper arm. Furthermore, I've also implemented three "fingers" to the top part of the upper arm in the code. You can also now move each of the three fingers with three degrees of freedom (x, y and z direction) as well. With this portion completed, I have sucessfully implemented everything as specified in the P6 handout.  So ultimately, I would say that for this project I completed it with 100% accuracy. There were no major problems encountered while implementing this.
